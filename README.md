### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harry Thuku Omolloh and Im a self-taught developer from Kenya. Im currently learning Web3 and also looking for a Junior level Backend developer role. I have experience in working with Python, JavaScript, React.js, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and etc. Here is a little fun story of how I got into coding. 
enjoy!

As a kid I wasn't really into computers but I was really curious and I read alot of books and loved watching documentaries. if you gave me a choice between watching a 2hr movie or watching a 10hr documentary on String theory or Dark matter and Dark energy, I would always choose the latter. I didn't get into coding and computer science until I was 15.

My first programming language was C++. I must say it was really hard! but it put me on the map and I got to understand the basic fundamentals from it. I later learned C# and Unity and started building video games. At this point, I was sure about my career path and the person I wanted to become in future. Because getting game development jobs was hard, I decided to learn Javascript and start Web development. At this point I had finished Highschool and ready to join Uni.

The main reason I got into tech was because I wanted to learn how video games were made. Learning the necesary skills was the easy part. Getting in the industry from my country was the hard part because virtually no one was doing it and this made me "pivot". I developed an Interest in Artificial intelligence but I decided to learn Web development first because it was easier to get freelancing gigs in Web dev.

Im currently into AI and Blockchain Technology but I still build web apps and modile apps using Python Django and React Native on the side. My long-term goal is to become a Tech enterpreneur. I'm seeing that happening in the world of Blockchain and AI. I want to help build a future powered by Blockchain and AI, and also help solve some of the world problems with this technologies.

Aside from computers, I love reading books, watching documentaries, Music, Chess and Watching Series(Crime Investigation mostly) my favorite being The Blacklist.

Great things happen when Creativity meets imaginationâœ¨
